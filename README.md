# RayTracerJS

RayTracerJS is a JavaScript-based test project that implements ray tracing using WebGL to render 3D objects.

## Features

- **3D Object Rendering**: Displays a pyramid, teapot, and a sun-like sphere with accurate geometry.
- **Real-Time Ray Tracing**: Implements basic ray tracing algorithms for realistic lighting and shading.
- **Interactive Controls**: Allows rotation and transformation of objects to view from different angles.
- **Lighting Effects**: Simulates light sources to enhance the visual realism of the scene.
